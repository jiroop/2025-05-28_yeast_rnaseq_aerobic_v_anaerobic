# Pipeline for comparing gene expression between aerobically and anaerobically grown S. cerevisiae

## Features
- Assess read quality with FASTQ
- Trim reads with Trimmomatic
- Reassess read quality post trimming
- Mapreads to the s288c transcriptome with Salmon
- Determine differentially expressed genes with DESeq2
- Determine enriched functional gene groups
- Determine genes that are minimally expressed in one condition, and expressed at moderate or high levels in the other
